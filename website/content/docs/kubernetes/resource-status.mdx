# Resource Status

Waypoint tracks the Kubernetes resources created during deployment
and can show you their details and health status in the web UI and CLI.
This helps show that what Waypoint is doing isn't magic and isn't trying
to hide anything, and lets developers and operators more easily debug
their deployments when something isn't healthy.

## Viewing Resource Status

TODO: UI

You may also view the resource status in the CLI. While in your project
repository (with a `waypoint.hcl` file), execute `waypoint status`. To
view detailed status about a specific app, specify the `-app` flag with
the name of the application.

```shell-session
$ waypoint status
TODO
```

## Refreshing Resource Status

When viewing the resource status in the UI or the CLI, Waypoint by default
will show you the _most recent status report_, but this report may be minutes
old. You can request a refreshed status report in the CLI by specifying the
`-refresh` flag. Note that this may cause the `status` operation to take
anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes depending on the size of your
deployment and the load on Kubernetes.

```shell-session
$ waypoint status -refresh
TODO
```

-> **Refresh functionality is not available in the UI, yet.** Unfortunately,
you can't currently force a status report refresh in the web UI. We will
implement this soon.
